# Downloading and Running a Next.js Project Locally

Here are the steps to download and run a Next.js project on a local machine:

**Downloading and Setting up the project locally:**

1. Visit your project's repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Clone or download" button and copy the HTTPS or SSH URL.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
4. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/xsankalp13/show-store-website.git
```
This command will download the code from the repository to your local machine.

5. Navigate into the project directory:

```shell
cd show-store-website
```
6. Install the required dependencies by running:

```shell
npm i
```
**Running the project:**

1. Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```
This command will start the development server and open up the project in your default browser.

2. You should now be able to view and interact with the project on your local machine.

**Note:** Before running the project, make sure you have installed Node.js on your local machine. If not, you can download it from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/
